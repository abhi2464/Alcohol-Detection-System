# Alcohol-Detection-System

Made a Alcohol Detection System using ESP-8266(Node MCU) which first detectes if a person is sitting on the driver's seat or not with the help of IR sensor. Then if someone if someone detected then it will start the alcohol sensor which records the aclohol level in driver's breath now if the level is above a certain threshold value the system will transmit data to the reciever and hence the car will not work or the it will stop.

For Wireless Transmission of data I have used two ESP-8266 and establised ESP-NOW Protocol between them.
